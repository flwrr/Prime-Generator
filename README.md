# Prime Generator
This assembly language program calculates up to the first 4000 prime numbers using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). The sieve formed in generating the n number of primes can be viewed afterward by pressing 'x', where each array element represents the value equal to its index (the first elements represents the number 0), and stores either a '1', marking a prime or a '0', marking a non-prime.
